This is a COBOL/CICS/VSAM based report viewing system.  While most z/OS shops
today have several ways to view reports.  I believe this system is unique in the
way it allows users to view reports.  There is an internal security system in
place that allows users to see only the reports or parts of a report they have
access to.  Multiple reports for multiple dates are normally stored in the VSAM
files.  Also, users are only allowed to view reports for the Bank and Branch
they have access to.  While this system was written for a Bank and Branch
environment it can be made to fit other formats.  Division and Department,
Region and Division,, etc.

This system has a batch process that scans (JES2) report data and builds data
records, index records and history records.  The CICS access process uses the
History and Index records to access the Report data.  Security records are used
to verify exactly what a user is allowed to view.

This system was originally written to view the printed version of a checking
account statement online thru CICS.  The code to do this is still in this system
and could be used to do something similar like display a customer statement as
it was created.
