This a general description of the package.

This is a COBOL/CICS/VSAM based report viewing system.  While
most z/OS shops today have several ways to view reports.  I
believe this system is unique in the way it allows users to view
reports.  There is an internal security system in place that
allows users to see only the reports they have access to or parts
of a report.  Multiple reports for multiple dates are normally
stored in the VSAM files.  Also, users are only allowed to view
reports for the Bank and Branch they have access to.  While this
system was written for a Bank and Branch environment it can be
made to fit other formats.  Division and Department, Region and
Division,, etc.

This system has a batch process that scans (JES2) report data and
builds data records, index records and history records.  The CICS
access process uses the History and Index records to access the
Report data.  Security records are used to verify exactly what a
user is allowed to view.

Sam my intent in the general copyright stuff was to say you can
you this system freely.  However I don't want someone to install
and use the system then charge their customers for using it.
Also I don't want someone to sell this system or at least not
sell it without including me.

Having said that we don't really have a good way to manage that
either.  In the end you have to trust folks.
