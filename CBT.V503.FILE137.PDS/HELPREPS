      number, say "10" on the command line and press the PF4 key.  This will
      move you up 10 lines from where you are.  But only within the same page.
      If no number is put on the command line 20 is assumed.  You can not go
      beyond the start or end of a page.  To get to the bottom lines on a page
      just put a number larger than the number lines on the page (99).  This
      will take you to the bottom of the page.

PF5 - Will move you down "N" LINES within the page you are currently on.  This
      PF key works just like PF4 except that it will move you down.

PF7 - Will go backwards "N" PAGES.  Put a number in the command line, say 5 and
      press the PF7 key.  This will move you backwards 5 pages from where you
      are.  If no number is entered.  One will be assumed.

PF8 - Moves you forward "N" PAGES.  It works just like the PF7 key except it
      moves forward.

PF11- Moves you right "N" positions.  Put a number, say 20 on the command line
      and press the PF11 key.  This will move you 20 characters to the right
      from where you are.  It will not move right of position number 133.  It
      will not rap around.  If no number is put on the command line then 20 is
      assumed.

PF12- Moves left "N" positions.  It functions just like PF11 except it moves to
      the left.


**NOTE**  PF keys 4, 5, 11 & 12, are used to move around on a page.  They do not
          change pages.  They either move up, down, left or right but always on
          the page you were on when you pressed the key.

**NOTE**  The PF7 & PF8 keys are used to change pages.  Where you are on the
          page does not change.  Only what page you are viewing.
          EX: You are on page 5.  By pressing the PF8 key(default 1 page) you
              will move to page 6.
